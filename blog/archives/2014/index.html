    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This past summer I set a goal for myself of finishing the
<a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Coursera</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml" target="_blank" rel="external">Machine Leaning
course</a> taught by Andrew Ng. The class has
been running for several years now and it’s been something I’ve thought about
doing since the first one but it wasn’t until this summer that I made the
commitment to myself to sit down and do it.  This was my first (and so far
only) experience with Coursera as a platform and unfortunately, it really left
a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>From an infrastructure perspective, the website itself really left a lot to be
desired, especially from a company that has <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coursera" target="_blank" rel="external">received $85
million</a> in funding. Page load
speeds felt really sluggish and even when they did load, I was presented with a
nice loading spinner signifying that I had only downloaded a skeleton webapp
that then needed to bootstrap and download the rest of the content. I can
understand this behavior if it only happens the first time I visit the site but
this is not the case with Coursera. Internal links also result in this spinner
which is particular frustrating because the content won’t fully load if the tab
is in the background. For those of you that like to open new tabs, wait for the
page to load, then view the content, you’ll feel my pain.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mCjTGZq.png?1" alt="" title="Coursera loading"></p>
<p>Another surprisingly large pain point for me was accessing the course wiki.
This was often frustrating because the wiki’s login system is not intimately
tied with that of the main webpage. Clicking the “course wiki” link in the main
class navbar opened a new page which then asked me to login again to see the
content. Even more annoying, the auth cookie is only set for the session
meaning I constantly had to re-login to the wiki site throughout the duration
of the course. For those of you thinking “what a minor and unimportant thing to
care about”, if your friend’s weekend hackathon project can save my session
indefinitely, why can’t Coursera?</p>
<p>As for the actual content of the course, I was pretty satisfied with the
material covered. Topics included various techniques in both
supervised and unsupervised learning and I most certainly walked away with a
better understanding of what exactly machine learning is and where it’s useful.
From what the course description tells me, there are typically different levels of
involvement people will have ranging from only watching the lectures to
completing all the assignments and doing the review questions. I fell into the
latter camp and every week, I’d sit down in front of my computer, fire up
Octave, and begin trudging through the assignments.</p>
<p>When I first started the course, I was really enthusiastic and would watch all
the lecture videos before attempting any of the review questions. As the course
wore on, however, I found myself slowly slipping back into my old college
habits. Often times, life would get in the way of being able to dedicate a
consistent amount of time each week to my studies and throughout the 10 week
course, I slowly began skipping through the lectures, before eventually
ignoring them altogether (which I suppose is the equivalent of skipping class).
Instead, I would skim through the wiki pages to get an overview of the material
and pound on the review questions until I got them all correct (thus learning
the material through trial and error).</p>
<p>Of all the various elements of the course, I found working through the
programming exercises to be the most informative and rewarding. As a
professional programmer and someone who actually paid attention to Linear
Algebra in high school, I spent minimal time wrestling with the Octave syntax
and often times found myself vectorizing equations without really thinking
about it (parts of the course were dedicated to re-writing iterative solutions
in vector form for performance reasons). Although It was nice to dust off those
matrix manipulation skills after several years, I couldn’t help but feel like
many of the assignments suffered from the “draw the owl” effect. No matter how
many times Professor Ng told me I “should now be an expert in machine learning”
after “building” a functional movie recommendation system, I couldn’t help but
feel that I had little idea how I had arrived there.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2NYl620.jpg" alt="" title="Draw the fucking owl"></p>
<p>Courera has always been an interesting website to me since I truly believe in
the vision of free knowledge for everyone. Even now, I get excited browsing
through the course listings and dreaming of learning everything from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/netsysbio" target="_blank" rel="external">bio
statists</a> to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ucimacroeconomics" target="_blank" rel="external">macro
economics</a>. Completing the
ML class has made me realize that Coursera really is about bringing the large
lecture University experience to the masses via the Internet. It also reminded
me why I chose to graduation college early myself: because that experience just
wasn’t compatible with how I learn best.</p>

        <p>Recently, I’ve been developing a custom static site generator using
<a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">gulp</a>. Among other things, one of the requirements of the
site is to automatically process multiple markdown files into webpages for
inclusion on the site. As an author of long markdown documents, it’s often
convenient to split these documents into multiple files and give them names
with numbers to signify what order they should be assembled then. This presents
a problem, however, because computer programs tend to sort strings in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Order" target="_blank" rel="external">ASCIIbetical order</a> meaning they are
sorted by comparing character ASCII values to each other.</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">$ ls -<span class="number">1</span></div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">1</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">10</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">2</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">3</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">4</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">5</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">6</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">7</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">8</span>.md</div><div class="line">part-<span class="number">9</span>.md</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>When we try and feed these files through our gulp pipeline, <code>part-10.md</code> will
be inserted between <code>part-1.md</code> and <code>part-2.md</code>. The way to get around this
problem is by using something called a “natural sort” which attempts to sort
names in way a human would do so. There are many different implementations of
this sort that will try to recognize all sorts of things from dates and times
to IP addresses. The sort is not always perfect but for my purposes of sorting
alphanumeric strings in a logical way, it works just fine.</p>
<p>In order to incorporate this sort into my gulp pipeline, I created a quick gulp
plugin that when applied to a stream, will re-emit the files in a naturally
sorted way. It uses the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/natural-compare-lite" target="_blank" rel="external">natural-compare-lite</a>
library but can be easily modified to use any other sorting algorithm.</p>
<p>Head on over to <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-natural-sort" target="_blank" rel="external">npm</a> to check
it out or view the source code over at

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I recently started on an
<a href="http://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ionic</a>/<a href="http://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cordova</a> app
that uses <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gulp</a> as the main build system. While I’ve used
<a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grunt</a> several times in the past I have found Gulp to be
much more of an intuitive approach and definitely easier to work with.</p>
<p> <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v9Z1NslDIYA/U5oAC052K3I/AAAAAAAAAXs/V88Gf_1cOT8/s1600/gulp_cordova_livereload.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In a Cordova project, you develop the application in the <strong>$ROOT_DIR/www/</strong>
directory. When you build the project for ios, Cordova copies those files from
that directory to <strong>$ROOT_DIR/platforms/ios/www</strong> directory. In order to
streamline the development process, I wanted to make use of<br><a href="http://livereload.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">livereload</a> via the 
<a href="https://github.com/vohof/gulp-livereload" target="_blank" rel="external">gulp-livereload</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/fingerproof/cordova-plugin-gapreload" target="_blank" rel="external">cordova-gapreload</a> plugins.
The basic setup is to use Gulp to watch for changes in the www/ directory and
when a change is detected, copy the file to the appropriate location in the
<strong>platforms/ios/www</strong> directory before triggering livereload. The main reason
for copying files is that the gapreload plugin looks for assets served relative
to the <strong>platforms/</strong> directory.</p>
<p>As you’d expect with any project, asset files can be numerous and the build
system itself should not impose a restriction on nested folders. These
requirements make manually listing files and structures an onerous task that
should be avoided. Fortunately, file
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming" target="_blank" rel="external">globbing</a>) exists precisely to
simplify this task. When specifying files to watch, you can use a glob pattern
to match multiple files in many directories with a single expression. For
example, to watch all files in the <strong>www/</strong> directory, you could specify a
route glob as such:  <strong>www/**</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong>  Pretty much every JS library I’ve found that does any sort of
route matching with globs uses the
<a href="https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch" target="_blank" rel="external">minimatch</a> library. Currently this
library has what I consider to be unintuitive, undocumented, and even incorrect
behavior. The library does not do path normalization before matching which
leads to the library not recognizing the equality of paths prefixed with the
relative “./“ compared to those that are not. Thus a glob specified as
.<strong>/www/**/*.js</strong> would <strong>NOT</strong> match the path <strong>www/app/test.js</strong> . In the
Gulp ecosystem at least, it seems that path names are piped between processes
without the “./“ so I would recommend that <strong>any relative paths or globs you
manually specify not have the “./“ prefix.</strong></p>
<p>Once you have Gulp setup to properly watch your asset files and copy them to
the appropriate directory, the next step is to configure a basic http server to
serve those assets, then trigger a livereload. I fulfilled the first
requirement using the simple
<a href="https://github.com/jesusabdullah/node-ecstatic" target="_blank" rel="external">ecstatic</a> module configured to
serve all files from the <strong>platforms/ios/www/</strong> directory on port 8000. <strong>Make
sure your assets are served with a very short cache time</strong> . This can be done
with ecstatic by specifying <strong>cache: 0</strong>  in the config object.   Once Gulp
copies a changed file to the appropriate directory, pipe the new file to
livereload to trigger the change.</p>
<p>The final step is to install the the Cordova plugin. From your root directory
type: <code>cordova plugin add pro.fing.cordova.gapreload --variable
SERVER\_HOST=&quot;&lt;host&gt;&quot;</code> where <strong><host></host></strong>  is the is the computer the files are
hosted from. If you’re developing with the emulator, this would probably be
<strong>localhost</strong>  however you can also specify any IP  you want meaning you can
use this setup when developing with an actual device</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion_That’s_pretty_much_it!_Now_when_you_save_a_file,_Gulp_should">Conclusion That’s pretty much it! Now when you save a file, Gulp should</h3>
<p>automatically detect the file has changed, copy it to the platforms directory,
then trigger a livereload action. You app running in the emulator should
instantly receive the livereload notification, load the changed file from the
server, then refresh the webview so the changes take effect.</p>
<h3 id="Caveats_This_setup_has_been_working_pretty_well_for_me_however_there_are">Caveats This setup has been working pretty well for me however there are</h3>
<p>some caveats that are important to mention. First of all, when using the
gapreload plugin XMLHttpRequests will be subject to cross origin restrictions
meaning you won’t be able to make normal requests to servers that don’t have
CORS enabled, even if you whitelist the domain in your config.xml.</p>
<p>Below are the relevant portions of my Gulpfile.js:</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The HTML audio element is pretty powerful, unfortunately, mobile browsers tend to restrict it by not letting you play more than one audio stream at once. Furthermore, these browsers will also restrict buffering multiple audio tracks making seamless audio switching difficult at best. While these restrictions are fine for most applications, some apps require many sounds to be played in quick succession. Games with sound effects are the biggest victim of this policy and the most commonly used strategy to circumvent it is to use <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/04/html5-audio-and-audio-sprites-this-should-be-simple/" target="_blank" rel="external">audio sprites</a>. Below, I will discuss an alternate method that makes use of XMLHttpRequests and the experimental Web Audio API to buffer audio files in parallel then seamless switch between them.</p>
<h3 id="Solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The first thing we need to do is setup our Web Audio API context. Because the spec has yet to be finalized, it may be necessary to use a vendor prefix:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="string">'webkitAudioContext'</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="built_in">window</span>) {</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> myAudioContext = <span class="keyword">new</span> webkitAudioContext();</div><div class="line">} <span class="keyword">else</span> {</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> myAudioContext = <span class="keyword">new</span> AudioContext();</div><div class="line">}</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, we simple check to see if the prefixed version exists, if not we use the non prefixed version.</p>
<p>The XMLHttpRequest object has received some major updates in the last few years. In addition to being able to send and receive text, it can now do the same with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ArrayBuffer" target="_blank" rel="external">arraybuffers</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob" target="_blank" rel="external">blobs</a>, and documents. Using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async" target="_blank" rel="external">Async.js</a> library, we simultaneously download multiple audio files as arraybuffers and save them for playback later:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> songUrls = [ <span class="comment">/* list of song URLs to buffer */</span> ];</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> songData = [];</div><div class="line">async.map(songUrls, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(url, cb)</span> </span>{</div><div class="line">  request = <span class="keyword">new</span> XMLHttpRequest();</div><div class="line">  request.open(<span class="string">'GET'</span>, url, <span class="literal">true</span>);</div><div class="line">  request.responseType = <span class="string">'arraybuffer'</span>;</div><div class="line">  request.addEventListener(<span class="string">'load'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(event)</span> </span>{</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">try</span> {</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">var</span> request = event.target;</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">var</span> source = myAudioContext.createBufferSource();</div><div class="line">      source.buffer = myAudioContext.createBuffer(request.response, <span class="literal">false</span>);</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">return</span> cb(<span class="literal">null</span>, source);</div><div class="line">    } <span class="keyword">catch</span> (err) {</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">return</span> cb(err);</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line">  }, <span class="literal">false</span>);</div><div class="line">  request.send();</div><div class="line">}, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="params">(err, result)</span> </span>{</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (err) {</div><div class="line">    $(<span class="string">'#message'</span>).text(<span class="string">"Error Buffering: "</span> + err);</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span>;</div><div class="line">  }</div><div class="line">  songData = result;</div><div class="line">});</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You’ll notice that once the array buffer is finished downloading we immediately create a new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode" target="_blank" rel="external">AudioBufferSourceNode</a> and populate it with the downloaded data using the createBuffer method (bonus: the preferred way to do this step is to use the <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis/webaudio/AudioContext/decodeAudioData" target="_blank" rel="external">decodeAudioData()</a> method because it’s asynchronous and has better error handling).</p>
<p>At this point, we now have an array of audio buffers so let’s look at how to play them back. The Web Audio API is based on the concept of nodes which allow you to channel data through various transformation functions before finally outputting it. For the sake of this tutorial, all we care about is playback so all we need to do is connect one of the buffers to the output device. We do that using the <strong>connect()</strong>  method:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">songData[<span class="number">0</span>].connect(myAudioContext.destination);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Although we can start playing the audio now, it is not ideal to do so because audio buffers cannot be restarted. To get around this, we first clone the audio buffer we want to playback:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">source = myAudioContext.createBufferSource(); source.buffer = songData[<span class="number">0</span>].buffer; source.connect(myAudioContext.destination); source.start(<span class="number">0</span>);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now, if we want to restart the track or switch to a new track, we can do so by calling <strong>source.stop(0)</strong>  then clone the next audio buffer and start playing it.</p>
<p>A working implementation of this method can be found at  <a href="http://emgeee.com/projects/web_audio_test" target="_blank" rel="external">http://emgeee.com/projects/web_audio_test</a></p>
<h3 id="Limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>While the method described overcome some of the limitations imposed by mobile browsers, it is still constrained by the need for some sort of user interaction before the audio can start playing. On the bright side, we can at least buffer the audio before hand so that when the user does hit play, the audio will start immediately. Normal HTML5 <audio> elements on mobile aren’t allowed to buffer until after the user hits play.</audio></p>
<p>Unlike the <audio> element, this method is also limited by XSS policies imposed by the browser. This means you will only be able to use it to stream media from the same domain or from a server that has CORS enabled.</audio></p>
<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This post describes a method for buffering audio in parallel and playing it back using the experimental Web Audio API.  I expect this method will become more robust in the future as the API is further standardized across browsers. I have tested this solution on both Chrome 35 for Android and Mobile Safari running on IOS7 with great results. Unfortunately, the stock Android browser does not support Web Audio, which is particularly unfortunate because that is what is used to run hybrid Cordova apps. For those looking to target IOS exclusively, however, I see this as a viable solution.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The other day I was attempting to install <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline" target="_blank" rel="external">powerline</a> to make my Vim setup look prettier when I ran into some trouble with how my system was configured. For those who don’t know, powerline is a neat status bar written in Python that provides various visual cues like what mode you are currently in. The  <a href="https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/osx.html#installation-osx" target="_blank" rel="external">instructions</a> for Mac told me install the package via <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip" target="_blank" rel="external">pip</a>, a Python package management system. This sounded easy enough however I quickly ran into some nuanced issues that had to be resolved.</p>
<p><img border="0" height="10" src="https://raw.github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-normal.png" width="400"></p>
<h3 id="Default_Python_on_Mac">Default Python on Mac</h3>
<p>By default, OSX comes preinstalled with several versions of Python. Theses version are used as dependencies for various software and, in general, should not really be messed with. The executables are made available via the <strong>/usr/bin</strong>  directory and should link back to <strong>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/</strong> . This is all well and good, however, there are a few problems: firstly, the version of Python in this directory is not necessarily up to day. For me, <strong>/usr/bin/python —version</strong>  yields version 2.7.5 while the most recent version is 2.7.6. More importantly, installing Python packages via the included version of pip require root access (<strong>sudo pip install <package name=""></package></strong>) because packages are saved to  <strong>/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages</strong>. Automatically running install scripts that are downloaded form the internet with root privileges is generally considered a possibly security risk and is something I strive to avoid at all cost.</p>
<h3 id="Enter_Homebrew">Enter Homebrew</h3>
<p>To rectify both these issues, I used the wonderful <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="external">Homebrew</a> (brew) package management system. By design, brew promises to never write files outside the directory specified by <strong>brew —prefix</strong>  which defaults to <strong>/usr/local/</strong>. Package information is saved to <strong>/usr/local/Cellar</strong> and executables are linked to <strong>/usr/local/bin</strong> . The beauty of this is that these directories don’t require root privileges to write to meaning if you ever need to <strong>sudo brew</strong>  anything, you’re probably doing something wrong.</p>
<p>To install an updated version of python, simple enter <code>brew install python</code>. Because brew will detect you already have a version of python installed on your system, it may be necessary to run <strong>brew link python</strong>, which will symlink the appropriate executables to <strong>/usr/local/bin</strong> . Now, assuming you have <strong>/usr/local/bin</strong>  in your $PATH (which you should), invoking <code>which python</code> should show you that you are now running the brewed version of python and <code>python --version</code> should now yield 2.7.6.</p>
<p>Rejoice! You should now have an updated version of python installed and managed by brew. <strong>which pip</strong>  should also show you are running the version that accompanied the brewed python.</p>
<h3 id="Installing_powerline">Installing powerline</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, powerline can be installed using pip. The exact command given by <a href="https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/osx.html#installation-osx" target="_blank" rel="external">the documentation</a> is <code>pip install --user git+git://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this presents an issue for brewed python. According to the brew-python documentation at <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-and-Python" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-and-Python</a>. The normal <code>pip install --user</code> is disabled for brewed Python. This is because of a bug in distutils, because Homebrew writes a <code>distutils.cfg</code> which sets the package <code>prefix</code>. Fortunately, the fix is quite simple. If you’ve installed python via brew, you can safely remove the <strong>—user</strong>  flag, which instructs pip to install the package into the <code>~/Library/Python/&lt;x&gt;.&lt;y&gt;/lib/python/site-packages/</code> directory. Instead, pip will install the package into  <code>/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages</code>, which shouldn’t require root privileges.</p>
<h3 id="Configuring_Vim">Configuring Vim</h3>
<p>The final step is to configure Vim (or whatever else you’d like to user powerline for). If, like me, you use vim or macvim installed through brew, you may have to do one last step. In order for powerline to work, Vim needs to be compiled with python support. Brew does this automatically at install time howeve, it relies on the first version of python found in the user’s $PATH when the program is installed. If you did not have brew installed python at the time you installed vim or macvim, you will need to reinstall these versions using something like  <strong>brew reinstall macvim <insert options="" like="" --enable-lua=""></insert></strong>. Vim will now be linked against the correct version of python and have access to the installed modules.</p>
<p>You should now be able to add the following lines to your vimrc file and bask in the glory of a nifty status bar</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">python</span> from powerline.<span class="keyword">vim</span> import setup <span class="keyword">as</span> powerline_setup</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">python</span> powerline_setup()</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">python</span> del powerline_setup</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Those are some of the things I learned while wrestling with brew and python for several hours. I have been using brew for a year or so prior to this without necessarily understanding some of the finer points of the system and no doubt had a lot of cruft on my machine as a result. Hopefully something in this post can save someone out there some time and/or headaches.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>For anyone how hasn’t heard of the <a href="http://ergodox.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ergodox keyboard</a> it
represents the state of the art in keyboard technology, at least if you don’t
care about having a mini OLED screen embedded in each key. The Ergodox has 3
qualities that make it a keyboard unique: it’s physically separated into two
halves, it adds new keys to form two distinct thumb clusters (similar to the
<a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kinesis</a>), and its
design is fully open source. All of these qualities combine to form a keyboard
that is great for someone who regularly sits in front of a computer long enough
to figure out how to actually build one — it’s ergonomically sound and every
key is reprogrammable. I ordered one off of
<a href="https://www.massdrop.com/home" target="_blank" rel="external">Massdrop</a>; here’s how I built it:</p>
<p>The components arrived in a box unassembled and cushioned by bubble wrap. I
opted for the cherry MX blue switches and the extended palm rest for this
build. Although I would have preferred brown switches, supply issues made is so
that those weren’t an option in the particular drop I participated in and I
wasn’t in the mood to source switched myself. Besides, if I was going to
assemble the keyboard anyways, I figured I could always unassembled it later
(or just buy a new one).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7gGV__dd9IY/U1782TM65lI/AAAAAAAAAVY/8IY4pPeEAOE/s1600/IMG_20140225_193902.jpg" height="320" width="240"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y3eCchocE3A/U1786Gqxj_I/AAAAAAAAAVg/VmYW5qXoAmc/s1600/IMG_20140225_194000.jpg" height="240" width="320"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--P0TUjesEy0/U1786czSrxI/AAAAAAAAAVo/4ELRN29VtJM/s1600/IMG_20140227_215522.jpg" height="240" width="320"></p>
<p>Because the build was going to require a good amount of soldering, I opted to
splurge a little bit on a decent soldering iron. I picked up a Weller WES51with
adjustable temperature for around $80 on Amazon and a generic solder sucker for
the occasional screwup. Because this build requires soldering surface mount
diodes, I highly recommend using a quality rig and if you can get a fine solder
tip, that’s even better.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxGLpIjPFk/U1787Ru2O6I/AAAAAAAAAV4/5OxWYNbfu28/s1600/IMG_20140428_171950.jpg" height="240" width="320"></p>
<p>The build began by soldering on a few resistors, headers, the headphone TRRS
jacks, and the Teensey micro-controller that serves as the brains of the
keyboard. The Ergodox PCB is designed such that both halves are actually copies
of the same PCB so one arbitrary choice later, I was happily on my way to a
semi-populated board. The kit contained two mini-B cables, one for connecting
the keyboard to the computer, and another for connecting the Teensy
micro-controller to the PCB. In order to accomplish the second task, the cable
had to be cannibalized so the connector would fit into the casing. Doing so
proved to be the most difficult (and dangerous) part of the entire build. I
opted to slowly whittle away at the insulation with a sharp knife, however, I
have heard that a Dremel is the most effective method.</p>
<p>!(<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxGLpIjPFk/U1787Ru2O6I/AAAAAAAAAV4/5OxWYNbfu28/s1600/IMG_20140428_171950.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxGLpIjPFk/U1787Ru2O6I/AAAAAAAAAV4/5OxWYNbfu28/s1600/IMG_20140428_171950.jpg</a>)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5rSK1lHs0HY/U1786biMsUI/AAAAAAAAAVk/dllqd4LC7bc/s1600/IMG_20140301_152137.jpg" height="300" width="400"></p>
<p>The next part is probably the part most people have trouble with. The plans
call for surface mount diodes to be painfully soldered next to each switch on
the PCB. Needle tweezers are a must in this situation and I found it easiest to
place a small dab of solder on one of the pads, then hold the diode over the
pad while re-melting the solder and moving the diode into the proper position.
Solder flux would have been very helpful in this situation however, I did not
have any on hand so I opted to charge ahead without it. During this step, it’s
absolutely important to ensure that each diode is <strong>facing the proper
direction</strong> . Failing to do so will render the keyboard inoperable and you will
have to go back and correct each incorrect diode. For this build, the tiny grey
stipe on the diode should be facing the square pad.</p>
<p>The next step is to begin mounting each switch onto acrylic frame. Because the
switches included in this kit are of the plate mounted kinda, as opposed to the
PCB mounted types, this step must be done before soldering them on the board.
This also means that if you want to change the case, you will have to desolder
every switch in order to fully liberate the PCB. These plate mounted switches
tend to be more durable than the alternatives, so that’s a win for stability,
still, it makes me sad that once you continue past this step, you’re locked
into using the original acrylic case.</p>
<p>I found it best to mount and solder each of the corner switches first before
filling in the middle. This makes it easier to line up the switches with their
respective holes. After this step is finished, be sure to inspect your work and
make sure every lead has enough solder on it and no <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/common-problems" target="_blank" rel="external">solder
bridges</a>
exist that could short circuit your keyboard. At this point, you should be able
to connect the two halves of the keyboard and plug it into your computer.
You’ll have to flash the Teensy with the appropriate firmware but after doing
that, you should have a fully functioning keyboard, all that’s left is to
finish assembling the case and installing the keycaps.</p>
<p>The end result: my fully assembled Ergodox!
